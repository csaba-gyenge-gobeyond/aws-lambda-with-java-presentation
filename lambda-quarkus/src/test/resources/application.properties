# This is used by the quarkus lambda extension to determine our AWS Lambda handler.
#
# The handler implements the AWS Lambda RequestHandler interface but don't get confused, this
# is not going to be used as an AWS Lambda handler directly. Instead, the Quarkus Lambda Extension
# has its own AWS Lambda handler, which can be considered as a dispatcher that delegates the request/event
# to the handler bean referred by this property.
